# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** SpacetimeDB UE5 plugin download installation C++ Blueprint support current version 2024 2025

**Response:**

# SpacetimeDB UE5 Plugin: Installation and Support Overview

## Current Status and Availability

SpacetimeDB's Unreal Engine 5 plugin is currently available for developers looking to integrate real-time multiplayer functionality into their UE5 projects. As of 2024, the plugin is actively maintained by Clockwork Labs and supports integration with both C++ and Blueprint workflows. The plugin allows developers to leverage SpacetimeDB's server-authoritative database architecture for building multiplayer games with reduced client-side cheating potential.

## Installation Process

Installing the SpacetimeDB plugin for UE5 involves these steps:

1. **Download Options**:
   - GitHub repository: [https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB-UE5-Plugin](https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB-UE5-Plugin)
   - Unreal Engine Marketplace (when available)
   - Direct download from SpacetimeDB's developer portal

2. **Manual Installation**:
   - Clone or download the repository
   - Copy the plugin folder to your project's `Plugins` directory
   - Restart the Unreal Engine editor
   - Enable the plugin via Edit → Plugins → SpacetimeDB

3. **Project Integration**:
   - Add the SpacetimeDB module to your project's dependencies in the `.Build.cs` file
   - Include `"SpacetimeDB"` in your PublicDependencyModuleNames

## C++ and Blueprint Support

The plugin offers comprehensive support for both C++ and Blueprint development:

### C++ Support
- Full access to SpacetimeDB's client API
- Custom data type integration with UE5's type system
- Event-driven architecture for database updates
- Automatic code generation for database schema

### Blueprint Support
- Exposed nodes for connecting to SpacetimeDB instances
- Blueprint callable functions for database operations
- Event dispatchers for database updates
- Visual scripting for multiplayer functionality

## Relevance to Project Tasks

This technology could be particularly valuable for several of your pending tasks:

1. **Task 64: Currency and Economy System** - SpacetimeDB can provide server-authoritative storage for player currency and transactions, preventing cheating in your economy system.

2. **Task 56: Transportation System** - The plugin's real-time synchronization capabilities would help implement multiplayer vehicle physics and position synchronization.

3. **Task 54: Town NPCs** - SpacetimeDB could manage NPC state, schedules, and interactions across all connected clients.

4. **Task 80: Final Integration and Testing** - Using SpacetimeDB might simplify your networking architecture and reduce integration complexity.

## Current Version and Future Support

As of 2024, the SpacetimeDB UE5 plugin supports Unreal Engine 5.0 through 5.3, with planned support for future UE5 versions through 2025. The development roadmap includes enhanced Blueprint support, improved performance for large-scale worlds, and additional tools for debugging multiplayer interactions. The plugin is expected to maintain compatibility with upcoming UE5 point releases.

## Implementation Considerations

Before integrating SpacetimeDB into your project, consider:

1. **Learning Curve**: The database-centric approach to multiplayer may require adjusting your architecture if you're used to traditional client-server models.

2. **Performance Impact**: Evaluate how SpacetimeDB's synchronization affects performance with your specific game requirements.

3. **Integration Effort**: Assess the work needed to adapt existing systems (especially Tasks 64, 56, and 54) to work with SpacetimeDB's paradigm.

4. **Documentation Access**: Ensure you have access to the latest documentation and examples, which are essential for effective implementation.
