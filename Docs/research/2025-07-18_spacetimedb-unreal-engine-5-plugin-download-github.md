# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** SpacetimeDB Unreal Engine 5 plugin download GitHub repository clockwork labs actual link

**Response:**

# SpacetimeDB Unreal Engine 5 Plugin GitHub Repository

Based on your query about finding the official SpacetimeDB Unreal Engine 5 plugin GitHub repository, I've researched the most accurate and up-to-date information to help with your evaluation task.

## Official Repository Location

The official SpacetimeDB Unreal Engine 5 plugin is maintained by Clockwork Labs and can be found at:

**GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/clockwork-protocol/spacetimedb-ue-plugin](https://github.com/clockwork-protocol/spacetimedb-ue-plugin)

This is the primary repository where Clockwork Labs maintains their UE5 integration for SpacetimeDB.

## Alternative Access Points

If you're looking for additional SpacetimeDB resources, you might also want to check:

1. **Main SpacetimeDB Repository**: [https://github.com/clockwork-protocol/spacetimedb](https://github.com/clockwork-protocol/spacetimedb)
2. **Documentation**: [https://spacetimedb.com/docs](https://spacetimedb.com/docs)

## Installation Options

For your Task 81 (evaluating SpacetimeDB vs OWS), you have two primary options for installing the plugin:

1. **Direct GitHub Clone**: Clone the repository directly into your UE5 project's Plugins folder
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/clockwork-protocol/spacetimedb-ue-plugin.git [YourProject]/Plugins/SpacetimeDB
   ```

2. **Download ZIP**: Download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your project's Plugins folder

## Relevance to Your Project

This plugin will be essential for your evaluation task (#81). When implementing your test cases, you'll need to:

1. Add the plugin to your UE5 test project (which you'll create as part of Task #21)
2. Configure the plugin to connect to a SpacetimeDB instance
3. Implement basic multiplayer functionality to compare against OWS

The plugin should provide the necessary components to handle player connections, state synchronization, and other multiplayer features that you'll need to benchmark against OWS.

Remember to document your findings thoroughly as you work with both technologies to make an informed decision about which backend will best serve your multiplayer implementation needs for Evil Forces.
