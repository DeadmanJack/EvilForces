2. **Cost Optimization:** Critical for budget-conscious development
3. **Feature Alignment:** Perfect match for Evil Forces' requirements
4. **Risk Mitigation:** Reduces technical complexity and development risk

### 6.2 Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: OWS Implementation (Months 1-3)
- Set up OWS infrastructure
- Implement basic hub + instance architecture
- Test seamless travel and player persistence
- Validate cost optimization features

#### Phase 2: Custom Extensions (Months 4-6)
- Add custom server logic where needed
- Implement Evil Forces-specific features
- Optimize for specific gameplay requirements
- Performance tuning and testing

#### Phase 3: Production Readiness (Months 7-8)
- Full integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Demo preparation

### 6.3 Fallback Strategy

If OWS proves insufficient for specific requirements:

1. **Hybrid Approach:** Use OWS for orchestration, Epic Multi-Server for custom features
2. **Gradual Migration:** Start with OWS, migrate specific components to Epic Multi-Server
3. **Custom Extensions:** Extend OWS with custom server logic where needed

## 7. Technical Implementation Notes

### 7.1 OWS Integration Points
- **Hub Servers:** Rule town and future towns
- **Minigame Servers:** Food Fighters, Robot Fighters, Snowball Fight
- **Adventure Servers:** Haunted Village, Dark Carnival, Candy Land

## 8. Conclusion

For Evil Forces, **OWS is the recommended solution** due to:

1. **Development Efficiency:** Significant time savings for solo developer
2. **Cost Optimization:** Built-in server orchestration and scaling
3. **Feature Alignment:** Perfect match for the game's architecture
4. **Risk Reduction:** Proven solution with established community

The Epic Multi-Server Replication Plugin, while technically capable, would require substantial additional development effort and introduce significant complexity that doesn't align with the project's goals of efficient, cost-effective development.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with OWS implementation, with the option to extend or migrate specific components to Epic Multi-Server if needed for highly custom requirements.
